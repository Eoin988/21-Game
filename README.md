### Features Left to Implement

- Add a function to show the dealers values after a result is achieved.

## Testing 


- I maunally tested each function as it was created
- Some control functions could not be used before a game was started, so a message was implemented for when this case occured. Each button that needed this message was tested manually.
- Each function was fully tested individually first, then all together when all functions had been creeated and implemented.
 - I confirmed the colours and fonts chosen are easy to read by running it through lighthouse in devtools [W3C validator](https://github.com/Eoin988/21-Game/blob/main/assets/media/lighthouse.PNG)
