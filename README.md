### Features Left to Implement

- Add a schedule page or section so the user can see what time are partially booked or free, before looking to book a session.

## Testing 


Testing was carried out as each section was created or edited.
A problem found was to add color to the header and footer. No fix for adding color to the header was found but partial footer color was added.
Adding images in line with text proved problematic but the result is satisfactory.
Once the site was deployed no images loaded. Many solutions had been tried before discovering the delay between pushing to git hub and the result having effect.
Also once deployed the free and contact links on the solo and group pages no longer worked. 
The alignment of items in the what we do section and the nav bar on the header proved problematic on smaller screens. Although the is still room for improvement in the nav bar alignment, the site is still functional on smaller screens.
